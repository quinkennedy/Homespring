<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span><br>
<br>
If you are new to programming, you should probably start somewhere
else. This is not intended to be a usable language, and it may
permanately sour you on programming. It is in no way representative of
what programming is like. This tutorial assumes you know some real
language already. You have been warned. Your milage may vary. May cause
birth defects.<br>
<br>
Before you can start writing Homespring code, you need to understand
its lexical structure, that is, the meanings of various characters.
It's pretty simple; programs are divided into tokens seperated by
single spaces or newlines. So the program<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Hello, world</span><br>
<br>
contains two tokens, 'Hello,' and 'world'. If you double the space
inbetween the words there, you will create a blank token inbetween
'Hello' and 'World'. These blank tokens have a special meaning that
we'll get to later. So remember that tokens are seperated by a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">single</span> space. Two spaces is not the
same as one space.<br>
<br>
Tokens can also be seperated by newlines, so this<span
 style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
<br>
Hello,<br>
world</span><br>
<br>
is equivalent to the above. Now what if you want a space in a token?
You have to escape it using a period ('.'). So this<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
Hello,. world</span><br>
<br>
is interpreted as one token, 'Hello, world'. If you happen to want an
actual period in a token, you need to escape it too. But as it so
happens, periods are escaped with spaces. So,<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Hello,. world .</span><br>
<br>
means 'Hello, world.'. Finally, if you want to put a newline in a
token, use a period that is not followed or preceded by a space. So to
put a newline at the end of that Hello World token, do this:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Hello,. world ..</span><br>
<br>
But, of course, if you put another token after that, the period is
instead used to escape the space, making them one token. To get around
this, you need to put all tokens that end in newlines at the end of a
line, and all tokens that begin in newlines at the beginning. And if
you want a token that's just a newline, use a period on a line by
itself.<br>
<br>
So what happens when you have a program containing space-dot-space or
dot-space-dot? Who knows?<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Program Structure</span><br>
<br>
All HS programs take the form of trees. The way the tokens are put
together into a tree is kind of unusual. Let's look at an example:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">a b c</span><br>
<br>
This program is parsed into this tree:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; /<br>
&nbsp; b<br>
&nbsp;/<br>
a<br>
<br>
</span>As you see, each token is a child of the preceding token. To
change this, you have to use the special blank tokens, which tell the
parser to move up a level. So:<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">a b&nbsp; c</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;"></span><br>
<br>
becomes:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
&nbsp; b<br>
&nbsp;/<br>
a<br>
&nbsp;\<br>
&nbsp; c<br>
<br>
</span>If the parser can't move down any more, the blank token is just
treated like a normal token. So yes, every possible string of characters
is a valid Homespring program! Also, it should be noted that the null
program (that is, a completely blank program) is special. When this
program is run, the interpreter prints the message 'In Homespring, the
null program is not a quine.' and exits.<br>
<br>
The program we'll be looking at in the next section:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">bear hatchery Hello,. World ..<br>
&nbsp;powers<br>
</span><br>
Is interpreted as:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Hello, world.\n</span><br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">hatchery<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \<br>
</span> <span style="font-family: monospace;">bear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">powers</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What This Does</span><br>
<br>
The basic idea here is that of salmon. Yes, <a
 href="http://www.riverdale.k12.or.us/salmon.htm">salmon</a>. The
program is a tree or rivers that flow out into the ocean. In our
example program, the 'bear' is at the point where the river flows out
into the ocean. The ocean represents the input and output streams.<br>
<br>
Now back to the salmon. Whenever a line of input is read, it is
encapsulated in a salmon. This salmon swims upstream looking for its
home, the place where it hatched. Once it reaches its home, it spawns.
The salmon's value (the line of input that it represents) determines
which node is its home. So if the salmon's value is 'Hello, World.\n',
its home is that node.<br>
<br>
Salmon that can't find their home just go as far as they can to the top
side of the tree, until they can go no further. They spawn there.<br>
<br>
When a salmon spawns, it creates a new salmon. This salmon has the
value of the spring where it was hatched, regardless of its parent's
value. Also, the new salmon is <span style="font-style: italic;">young</span>.
This can affect a number of things, as we shall see. If the salmon that
spawns is young, it becomes <span style="font-style: italic;">mature</span>
(not young). Anyway, both salmon now swim downstream, until they reach
the ocean. Once they do, their values are output.<br>
<br>
The salmon have a specified order in the list, and they are output in
that order. New salmon are inserted at the beginning of the list. Oddly
enough, the order of the list is reversed every time they enter a new
node.<br>
<br>
So what does our example program do?<br>
<br>
The first node is a 'bear'. We'll get to that later, because the
program really starts with the 'powers'.<br>
<br>
'powers' generates electricity. Everything downstream of the 'powers'
node gets power, unless the electricity is blocked somehow.<br>
<br>
'hatchery' is the main thing here. It keeps creating new salmon
whenever it's powered. These salmon are mature, have the value
'homeless' and immediately swim upstream like an input salmon.<br>
<br>
Since there is no node called 'homeless', the salmon just swims up the
top branch, and stops at 'Hello, world.\n' Here it spawns. So now there
are two salmon there, a mature one called 'homeless' and a young one
called 'Hello, world.\n'.<br>
<br>
The 'Hello, world!\n' node is a <span style="font-style: italic;">spring</span>.
Any node that isn't a keyword is a spring. Springs generate water,
which flows downstream. Water doesn't enter into this program (it's
assumed that there's always enough for salmon to swim), but it needed
to be mentioned somewhere.<br>
<br>
These two salmon now swim downstream. Before long they reach 'bear'.
'bear' eats mature salmon. Young salmon are too small for bears. So now
only the 'Hello, world.\n' salmon is left. It exits and its value is
displayed.<br>
<br>
Of course, all this while, the hatchery is still doing its thing, so
the program prints 'Hello, world.\n' ad infinitum. We'll fix that next.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Making a Program that
Actually Ends</span><br>
<br>
Here it is:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">universe bear hatchery Hello,.
world!.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;powers&nbsp;&nbsp; marshy
marshy snowmelt</span><br>
<br>
or<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Hello, world!</span><br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; /</span><br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hatchery<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">snowmelt</span><br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
powers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
marshy<br>
universe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marshy _________ /</span><br>
<br>
This is the same as the other program, but with a few things added. The
'snowmelt' node creates snowmelt, which flows downstream like water. It
destroys certain things.<br>
<br>
The 'marshy' nodes slow down snowmelt, so it takes two ticks for it to
pass through them.<br>
<br>
The 'universe' is the entire cosmos of the program. It can be smashed
up by snowmelt. So when snowmelt hits it, the program ends. It is timed
so it ends just after the first 'Hello, world!\n' message makes it out.<br>
<br>
It should be noted that snowmelt is updated first, then water, then
electricity, then salmon, then special things like bear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Embellishment</span><br>
<br>
This program works, but it doesn't really have complete sentences. It's
better written like this:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Universe of bear hatchery says
Hello. World!.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;
powers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the marshy things;</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">the power of the snowmelt overrides.</span><br>
<br>
This program is functionally equivalent, but it looks like a strange
poem. That is considered a Good Thing is HS terms.<br>
<br>
One last note: some keywords have spaces in them. Remember to escape
them with periods.<br>
